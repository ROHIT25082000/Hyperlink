# Hyperlink
## URL shortening Service in python. <br>
You can paste a Long URL (without http://) and you get a small url which shortens the original URL. <br>  
Shortened Urls are available forever until the original website goes down<br>

Uses B62 hash algorithm.

As of now the UI is not very mobile friendly .. But I will make it in future.
